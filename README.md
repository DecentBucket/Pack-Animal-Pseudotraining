# Pack Animal Training (kinda)
 My personal take on the "Why can't I use my thrumbo as a pack animal?" problem: you have to ~~bribe~~ train them first!

 Includes settings to respect (or ignore) the packAnimal property, what an animal needs to learn, and supports modded trainables out of the box.
 
## This mod does not add any trainables!
 If I were to add one I'd want to make it customizable and would likely require a restart to apply changes, but I've spent enough time on this and I would like to move on!
