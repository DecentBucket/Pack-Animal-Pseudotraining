# Pack Animal Training (kinda)
 My personal take on the "Why can't I use my thrumbo as a pack animal?" problem: you have to ~~bribe~~ train them first!

 Includes settings to respect (or ignore) the packAnimal property, what an animal needs to learn, and supports modded trainables out of the box.
 
## This mod does not add any trainables!
 If I were to add one I'd want to make it customizable and would likely require a restart to apply changes, but I've spent enough time on this and I would like to move on!

Additionally, this mod does not add any textures to the game. If you want visible packs on animals, you will need a mod that adds those textures. Such as [Pack Mules Extended](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1501052499) or [VFME - Caravan Packs](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2255432128).
