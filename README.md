# Pack Animal Training (kinda)
 My personal take on the "Why can't I use my thrumbo as a pack animal?" problem: you have to ~~bribe~~ train them first!
 This is a Rimworld mod that allows animals to be used as pack animals based on set trainables that can be set by the player.
 Includes settings to follow (or ignore) the packAnimal property, and what an animal needs to learn.
## This mod does not add any trainables!
 If I added one I'd want to make it customizable and would likely require a restart to apply changes, but I've spent a lot of time on this and would like to move on!
